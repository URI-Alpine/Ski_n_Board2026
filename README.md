# Ski & Board 2026 Repository:
A repository with the express purpose of tracking and managing tasks and events.

## There is much to do and explore in this Repository!
### Check out the [Project Section](https://github.com/orgs/URI-Alpine/projects/1/views/1)
  The Projects section is the home of The Ski Hub, the one stop shop for creating and managing tasks for all to see!

### Or take a look at this year's [Executive Board](https://github.com/orgs/URI-Alpine/teams/eboard-2026)
  By using the teams feature we can organize members of the repo, allowing different permissions to different people and roles
