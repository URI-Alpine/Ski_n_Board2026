# Ski & Board 2026 Repository Guide:
The Ski & Bord Repo exists with the express purpose of tracking and managing tasks and events.
Below is a shining a spotlight on some of the top tools in the repo.

## There is much to do and explore in this Repository!
### Check out the [Project Section](https://github.com/orgs/URI-Alpine/projects/1/views/1)
  The Projects section is the home of The Ski Hub, the one stop shop for creating and managing tasks for all to see!

### Or take a look at this year's [Executive Board](https://github.com/orgs/URI-Alpine/teams/eboard-2026)
  By using the teams feature we can organize members of the repo, allowing different permissions to different people and roles

### There is also a [Discussion Section](https://github.com/URI-Alpine/Ski_n_Board2026/discussions)
  In the Discussion section you can create an open dialogue about a topic, task, issue or event. With the ability to reference these discussions in project tasks, it should prove to be a useful feature!

### You cant forget about the [Issues Tab](https://github.com/URI-Alpine/Ski_n_Board2026/issues)
  Here is a list of all the things or *issues* entered into the SkiHub, offering a comprehensive top-down view.
